so this the back end 

[so its has following basic jobs]

1 user authentication and rate limiting 
2 pass this code to message queue 
3 with task id and return task id to user also 
4 code executor will execute the job return with task id 
5 code executor will update the task status to completed and return the result to user


api call from client site to user site 

information need from client site 
{
    user info for rate limiting and auth ,
    coding language ,
    code , 
    input

}

information will be sended to client for aclknowledgement 
{
    user info ,
    taks id 
     // this task will be used to identify if the task is completed or not 
}



So what will the entry point do 

- get api to run code from user
- it will create an  job uid for the code
- send this job uid to message queue
- update state of job by uid in the quick cache
- check pooling req of user
- check again quick cache
- if the code is there in the dynamo db fetch it
- serve to the user
